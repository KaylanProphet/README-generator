## Description
The README Generator helps users easily create a README.md file based on the users answers to a series of questions pertaining to the project. 
## Installation
At this time for a user to access the README Generator they must clone the repository and use the "npm install" command. This will install the required Node.js packages needed for the README Generator.
## Usage
Once installed the user will utilize the README Generator through the command line. Entering "node index.js" will prompt the user with a series of questions about their project. Once this information is gathered the README Generator will compile it into a professional README.md file. The user will then access this file in the generated-readmes folder and will then be able to adjust the file as needed.
